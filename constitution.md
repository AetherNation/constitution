# The Constitution of the Aether Nation
### _Ad Astra Et Ultra_
---
## Preamble
As humans who originate from this pale blue dot that we call Earth, regardless of our race, gender, sexuality, place of birth, residence, nationality, language, religion, ability, or disability, desire to extend our reach to other celestial bodies and unite humanity’s future generations in our exploration of the cosmos. In good faith, we the People of the Aether Nation, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Aether Nation.

## Article 1. Form of Government
The Aether Nation functions as a Constitutional Monarchy, with the Aetherlord recognized as the head of state, with the executive being vested in the Aetherlord of the Aether Nation. The legislative power of the Aether Nation resides in the House of Elementals. The judicial power of the Aether Nation resides in the Aether Sages.

### Section 1. Executive
The executive power in the Aether Nation resides in the Aetherlord. The Aetherlord holds his/her/their office by right of birth/adoption. At the time of the death or abdication of an Aetherlord, the oldest child, biological or adopted, may choose to accept the throne. If the oldest child rejects the position of Aetherlord, the throne becomes available to the next child, in order of age. If no descendants, biological or adopted, of the previous Aetherlord remain, the line of succession backtracks until a branch of the family tree is found containing the next closest relatives. The duty of the Aetherlord is to sign legislation presented by the House of Elementals into law or veto it. The veto may be overridden by a two-thirds majority vote by the House of Elementals unless the proposed legislation is deemed unconstitutional by the Aether Sages. The Aetherlord also has the duty of appointing members of his/her/their cabinet. Cabinet members consist of the following individuals:
* The Crown Prince/Princess/Princex of the Aether Nation. This individual is not appointed by the Aetherlord but rather designated by their position as first in the line of succession for the throne. Their duty is to learn the ways of the executive branch of government to prepare them for their future role as Aetherlord.
* Minister of Education. Responsible for the education system of the Aether Nation.
* Minister of Innovation. Responsible for driving innovation within the Aether Nation, keeping the state technologically strong.
* Minister of Cybersecurity. Responsible for protecting the state’s computer systems and networks from the theft and/or damage to hardware, software, or electronic data.
* Minister of Foreign Affairs. Responsible for diplomatic relations with other countries.

### Section 2. Legislative
The legislative power in the Aether Nation resides in the House of Elementals. The House of Elementals shall contain at any given time, an even number of individuals, not exceeding 50 members. The role of the House of Elementals is to draft and vote on laws. Any individual in the House of Elementals may propose a law, and laws pass with a 51% majority vote. Passed laws must move on to the Aetherlord for ratification. Meetings of the House of Elementals are led by the Grand Sage of the Aether Sages or a sage designated by the Grand Sage.

Members of the House of Elementals are voted directly by the citizens of the Aether Nation. Members elected into the House of Elementals serve on three-year terms. As an elected member of the House of Elementals, it is their duty to best represent the people of the Aether Nation in their decision making, and to best uphold the Constitution of the Aether Nation.

### Section 3. Judicial
The judicial power in the Aether Nation resides in the Aether Sages. The duty of the Aether Sages is to verify that all government activity is in line with the Constitution of the Aether Nation. The Aether Sages serve as the highest court in the Aether Nation. The Aether Sages shall consist of six sages, led by one grand sage. It is the job of the Grand Sage to oversee judicial activity within the Aether Sages, to oversee activity within the House of Elementals, and to perform coronations of new Aetherlords. Aether Sages retain their position for life, until death or resignation. Appointing individuals to the Aether Sages is done by the Grand Sage with approval of the House of Elementals. A new Grand Sage is selected at the resignation of the previous, or appointed by the Aetherlord of the previous Grand Sage is deceased.

## Article 2. General Provisions

To apply for citizenship, one must be at least the age of sixteen and must have maintained a minimum of six months of residency, and be a resident at the time of application. The six months of residency requirement may be waived at the discretion of the Aetherlord or Grand Sage. Citizenship may never be revoked.

Residency is the step needed before seeking citizenship. Residency may be revoked if a crime against the state is committed, and the Aether Sages see revocation of residency as necessary.
